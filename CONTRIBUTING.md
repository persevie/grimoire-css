# Contributing to Grimoire CSS

Thank you for considering contributing to Grimoire CSS! We welcome all forms of contribution: code, documentation, examples, and more. This guide outlines the process and standards for contributing to the project.

## Development Workflow

We follow a structured Git workflow to manage the lifecycle of code and contributions. This approach provides organization while remaining flexible to accommodate contributions from the community.

### Branch Structure

- **`main`**: The stable branch where production-ready code resides. Only thoroughly tested and approved code is merged here via pull requests.

- **Feature Branches**: Branches for developing individual features or enhancements.

  - Naming convention: `feature/{feature-name}`

- **Fix Branches**: Branches for regular bug fixes intended for the next release.

  - Naming convention: `fix/{fix-description}`

- **Release Candidate Branches**: Branches for preparing specific releases.

  - Naming convention: `rc/{version}` (e.g., `rc/1.2.0`)

- **Hotfix Branches**: Branches for urgent fixes to production code that cannot wait for the next release.

  - Naming convention: `hotfix/{hotfix-description}`

- **Chore Branches**: Branches for maintenance tasks such as updating documentation, CI configurations, or other non-feature/non-fix changes.
  - Naming convention: `chore/{chore-description}`

### Workflow Overview

#### 1. Proposing a New Feature, Fix, or Chore

We encourage contributors to propose new features, fixes, or chores, even if they're not part of our current roadmap or milestones.

- **Open an Issue**:
  - Before starting work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/persevie/grimoire-css/issues/new/choose) to propose your feature, describe the bug you're fixing, or explain the chore task.
  - Use the appropriate issue template provided to give detailed information.
  - This allows maintainers and the community to discuss your proposal and provide feedback.

#### 2. Development

- **Create a Branch from `main`**:

  - For features:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/{feature-name} main
    ```
  - For regular fixes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/{fix-description} main
    ```
  - For hotfixes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b hotfix/{hotfix-description} main
    ```
  - For chores:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b chore/{chore-description} main
    ```

- **Implement Your Changes**:

  - Follow the code quality and style guidelines outlined below.
  - Include tests and documentation updates as necessary.

- **Open a Pull Request**:

  - **Target Branch**:
    - For features and regular fixes:
      - Open a PR against the appropriate `rc/{version}` branch.
      - If unsure which release your contribution will fit into, you can initially target your PR to `main`, and maintainers will retarget it as needed.
    - For hotfixes and chores:
      - Open a PR directly against `main`.
  - **PR Description**:
    - Reference the issue you opened (e.g., "Closes #123").
    - Provide a clear description of your changes.

- **Collaborate on the Review**:
  - Be responsive to feedback from maintainers and reviewers.
  - Discuss any questions or concerns raised during the review process.

#### 3. Preparing a Release

- **Creating a Release Candidate Branch**:

  - **Branch from `main`**:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b rc/{version} main
    ```
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b rc/1.2.0 main
    ```

- **Merging Feature and Fix Branches**:

  - Maintainers will merge feature (`feature/**`) and fix (`fix/**`) branches intended for the release into the `rc/{version}` branch via pull requests.

- **Testing and Stabilization**:
  - Perform thorough testing on the `rc/{version}` branch.
  - Resolve any issues or bugs discovered during testing.
  - Update documentation and version numbers as needed.

#### 4. Finalizing a Release

- **Merge into `main` via Pull Request**:

  - Open a pull request from `rc/{version}` into `main`.
  - Ensure all CI checks pass and that the code is reviewed.
  - Once approved, merge the PR into `main`.

- **Automated Tagging and Publishing**:

  - When a release candidate branch is merged into `main`, our GitHub Actions workflow automatically creates a tag (e.g., `v1.2.0`) based on the `rc/{version}` branch name.
  - The CI/CD pipeline then builds, releases, and publishes the new version.
  - **Note**: Do not manually create or push tags; the CI/CD pipeline handles tagging.

- **Delete the Release Candidate Branch**:
  ```bash
  git branch -d rc/{version}
  git push origin --delete rc/{version}
  ```

#### 5. Handling Hotfixes

- **Creating a Hotfix Branch**:

  - **Branch from `main`**:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b hotfix/{hotfix-description} main
    ```

- **Implementing the Hotfix**:

  - Develop and commit the hotfix.
  - Ensure all tests pass and code quality standards are met.

- **Open a Pull Request to `main`**:

  - Open a PR from `hotfix/{hotfix-description}` to `main`.
  - Reference the related issue and provide a clear description.

- **Review and Merge**:

  - Ensure the PR passes all CI checks and undergoes code review.
  - Upon approval, merge the PR into `main`.

- **Automated Tagging and Publishing**:

  - When the hotfix PR is merged into `main`, the CI/CD pipeline automatically increments the patch version and creates a new tag (e.g., from `v1.2.0` to `v1.2.1`).
  - The pipeline then builds, releases, and publishes the hotfix.
  - **Note**: Do not manually create or push tags; the CI/CD pipeline handles tagging.

- **Updating Other Branches**:
  - **Merge the Hotfix into Active `rc/{version}` Branches**:
    - If there are active release candidate branches, merge `main` into them to ensure the fix is included in future releases.
    ```bash
    git checkout rc/{version}
    git merge main
    ```

#### 6. Handling Chores

- **Creating a Chore Branch**:

  - **Branch from `main`**:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b chore/{chore-description} main
    ```

- **Implementing the Chore**:

  - Make the necessary changes (e.g., updating documentation, CI configurations).

- **Open a Pull Request to `main`**:

  - Open a PR from `chore/{chore-description}` to `main`.
  - Provide a clear description of the changes.

- **Review and Merge**:

  - Ensure the PR passes all CI checks and undergoes code review.
  - Upon approval, merge the PR into `main`.

- **Note**:
  - Merging `chore/**` branches into `main` will **not** trigger tagging or a new release.

#### 7. Updating Feature and Fix Branches

- **Sync with `main`**:
  - Regularly merge `main` into your feature (`feature/**`) and fix (`fix/**`) branches to keep them up to date.
    ```bash
    git checkout feature/{feature-name}
    git merge main
    ```
  - Resolve any merge conflicts that may arise.

### Automated Tagging and Publishing

Our CI/CD pipeline automates the tagging and publishing process:

- **Automated Tagging**:

  - When a release candidate (`rc/{version}`) or hotfix (`hotfix/**`) branch is merged into `main`, the GitHub Actions workflow automatically creates a tag:
    - For releases: `v{version}` (e.g., `v1.2.0`)
    - For hotfixes: Increments the patch version (e.g., from `v1.2.0` to `v1.2.1`)
  - **Important**: Do not manually create or push tags; the CI/CD pipeline handles tagging.

- **Build and Release**:

  - The pipeline builds the project for multiple platforms and creates a GitHub release with the compiled artifacts.

- **Publishing**:
  - The release is automatically published to [crates.io](https://crates.io) and other package managers as appropriate.

### Repository Security and Permissions

- **Branch Protection**:

  - The `main` branch is protected to ensure code quality and security.
  - All changes must be submitted via pull requests and reviewed before merging.
  - Direct pushes to `main` are not allowed.

- **Tagging Policy**:
  - Only the CI/CD pipeline should create and push tags for releases.
  - Manual creation or pushing of tags is prohibited to prevent unintended releases.
  - If you believe a tag needs to be created or updated, please discuss it with the maintainers.

### Project Management

We use GitHub Projects to maintain development and planning. Our project management process includes:

- **Issues**:

  - All tasks, features, bugs, and discussions are tracked using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/persevie/grimoire-css/issues).
  - Issues are labeled appropriately (e.g., `feature`, `bug`, `documentation`, `good first issue`, `chore`).
  - **Issue Templates**: We provide issue templates to guide you in providing the necessary information.

- **Milestones**:

  - Issues are organized into milestones corresponding to planned releases.
  - Milestones help track progress toward release goals.

- **Project Board**:

  - We maintain a [GitHub Project board](https://github.com/orgs/persevie/projects/4/views/1) that visualizes the progress of tasks across different stages (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done).
  - The board provides transparency and helps coordinate work among contributors.

- **Roadmap**:
  - Our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/persevie/projects/4/views/4) is reflected in the milestones and issues, providing visibility into upcoming features and priorities.

### Contribution Opportunities

- **Find an Issue**:

  - Browse the [Issues](https://github.com/persevie/grimoire-css/issues) to find tasks labeled as `help wanted` or `good first issue`.
  - Comment on the issue to express your interest in working on it.

- **Propose a New Idea**:

  - If you have an idea that's not already listed, feel free to open a new issue using the appropriate template.
  - Engage in discussions to refine your proposal.

- **Use GitHub Discussions**:
  - For questions, ideas, or general discussions, please use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/persevie/grimoire-css/discussions) instead of creating an issue.
  - This helps keep issues focused on actionable tasks and fosters community engagement.

   - Our CI pipeline ensures that improperly formatted code will fail the build.

2. **Linting**:

   - Use `cargo clippy` to ensure your code is free of warnings.
   - We treat warnings as errors:

     ```bash
     cargo clippy -- -D warnings
     ```

3. **Tests**:

   - All new features or fixes should include appropriate unit and/or integration tests.
   - Ensure tests pass before submitting a pull request:

     ```bash
     cargo test
     ```

## Code Style Guidelines

To maintain consistency across the project, please adhere to the following code style guidelines:

1. **Rust Formatting**:

   - Always use `cargo fmt` to format your code before committing.

2. **Clippy**:

   - Ensure that your code is free of warnings by running `cargo clippy` before submitting a pull request.

3. **Comments and Documentation**:

   - Use clear, concise comments to explain the logic of complex code blocks.
   - All public APIs should have appropriate RustDoc comments.
