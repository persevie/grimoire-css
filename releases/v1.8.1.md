# v1.8.1

Small patch release focused on parser robustness, plus some CLI and VS Code extension reliability polish.

### Added

- CLI utilities: `--help` / `-h` / `help` and `--version` / `-V`.
- Help output improvements: mention both `grimoire_css` and `grim`, and print help when no mode is provided.

### Changed

- VS Code extension build: bundle the extension with `esbuild` for packaging.

### Fixed

- Parser: operator-like tokens inside `class={...}` template literals (e.g. `===`, `foo==bar`) are no longer misinterpreted as spells.
- VS Code extension: do not block activation on LSP startup; add timeouts for LSP start and network downloads to avoid hangs.
