# v1.6.0 Chromaspire: The Color Convergence

Grimoire CSS refines its arcane precision with **Chromaspire**, a release dedicated to mastery over color and stability. With a fully decoupled color toolkit, improved resilience, and groundwork for precise float-based styling, spellcasters now wield both grace and robustness.

## Key Highlights

- **Decoupled Color System**: Color module extracted to `grimoire_css_color_toolkit` crate for independent usage and improved maintainability.
- **Enhanced Parser Support**: Comprehensive support for curly bracket class syntax (`class={}`, `className={}`) with robust nested bracket handling.
- **Float-Based Precision**: Migration from `u32` to `f64` for unit handling, enabling precise floating-point calculations for responsive units.
- **Modern Rust Standards**: Upgraded to Rust Edition 2024 with minimum version 1.88 for enhanced language features and performance.
- **Improved String Formatting**: Modernized string interpolation using the latest Rust formatting conventions.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Refined project description and branding consistency across the ecosystem.
- **Robust Refactoring Support**: Added comprehensive support for refactor branches in contribution workflow.

## Full Details

### Color System Decoupling

- **Independent Color Toolkit**: Extracted the complete color module to `grimoire_css_color_toolkit` v1.0.0 as a standalone crate.
- **CSS Color Module Level 4 Compliance**: Maintained full compliance with CSS Color specifications for `rgb()`, `hsl()`, `hwb()`, hex codes, and named colors.
- **External Availability**: Color toolkit now available for independent use in other projects requiring CSS-compliant color parsing and manipulation.
- **Seamless Integration**: Existing color functionality remains fully accessible through the main Grimoire CSS module.

### Parser Enhancements

- **Curly Bracket Class Support**: Added comprehensive parsing for `class={}` and `className={}` syntax patterns.
- **Nested Bracket Handling**: Robust regex patterns that correctly handle nested curly brackets within class declarations.
- **Framework Compatibility**: Enhanced support for modern JavaScript frameworks and CSS-in-JS solutions.
- **Collection Type Management**: Implemented `CollectionType` enum for precise handling of different class collection scenarios.

### Precision and Performance

- **Float-Based Units**: Migrated unit handling from `u32` to `f64` for precise floating-point calculations.
- **Responsive Design Support**: Enhanced accuracy for `mfs`/`mrs` (minimum/maximum font-size) and other fluid sizing calculations.
- **Mathematical Precision**: Improved handling of complex responsive calculations with decimal precision.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized data structures while maintaining calculation accuracy.

### Language and Tooling Modernization

- **Rust Edition 2024**: Upgraded to the latest Rust edition for access to newest language features and optimizations.
- **Minimum Rust Version**: Set minimum supported Rust version to 1.88 for stability and security.
- **Modern String Formatting**: Migrated to contemporary Rust string interpolation patterns for improved readability and performance.
- **Dependency Updates**: Updated Clap to v4.5.41 with enhanced CLI argument parsing capabilities.

### Documentation

- **Consistent Terminology**: Standardized project description as "A magical CSS engine" across all documentation.
- **Enhanced Contributing Guidelines**: Added comprehensive support for refactor branches in the development workflow.

## Migration Notes

### For Library Users

- **Color Module**: If using color functions directly, update imports to reference the new `grimoire_css_color_toolkit` crate or continue using through the main module.
- **Unit Calculations**: Float-based calculations may produce slightly different results due to improved precision.
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing APIs remain compatible with previous versions.

### For Contributors

- **Refactor Branches**: New `refactor/{description}` branch naming convention available for code improvement contributions.
- **Modern Rust**: Development now requires Rust 1.88+ for optimal experience.
- **Testing**: Enhanced test coverage for curly bracket parsing and float-based calculations.

## Technical Improvements

### Core Architecture

- **Modular Design**: Color system decoupling improves overall architecture and reduces main crate complexity.
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced type safety with `CollectionType` enum for parser state management.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling for complex parsing scenarios.
- **Code Organization**: Better separation of concerns between core functionality and specialized modules.

### Parser Robustness

- **Regex Optimization**: Efficient regex patterns for curly bracket class detection with proper nesting support.
- **Quote Handling**: Enhanced quote detection and matching for complex class declarations.
- **State Management**: Improved parser state tracking for reliable multi-pattern matching.
- **Performance**: Optimized parsing pipeline for faster processing of complex markup.
