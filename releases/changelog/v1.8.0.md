### Added

- Scroll composition upgrades: argument-driven spell selection via `spellByArgs` and parameterized scroll invocations inside `scrolls[].spells` (e.g. `box=12px`).
- Rust Analyzer powering structured operations like index/explorer data, refs, stats, explain, lint, and DRY candidates.
- Feature-gated stdio LSP server (`grimoire_css_lsp`) exposing analyzer capabilities via `workspace/executeCommand`.
- First-party VS Code extension with views, navigation, highlights, and tooling actions.
- Scriptable CLI surface (`fi`) with machine-friendly JSON output (aligned with LSP commands).
- Additional CLI binary name: `grim` (alongside `grimoire_css`).

### Changed

- Hardened parsing/token extraction and tightened spell validation for more consistent diagnostics.
- Improved config/schema alignment for tooling and IDE workflows.
- Added optimizer controls to support readable (non-minified) CSS output for tooling.
- Updated MSRV to Rust 1.93.0.
