## The First Member

Hello! My name is [Dmitrii Shatokhin](https://dmtrshat.github.io/), and I am the creator of Grimoire CSS. I invented the Spell concept and all the other ideas behind the project. Grimoire CSS is the result of countless hours of work and dedication, and I am proud to have made it open source.

But this is just the beginning. I am committed to the ongoing development of Grimoire CSS and its entire ecosystem - there are many plans and tasks ahead, which I strive to manage transparently on GitHub. My vision is to grow the Arcane Circle community and bring all these ideas to life.

I would be truly grateful for any support you can offer - whether it’s starring the project on GitHub, leaving feedback, recommending it to others, contributing to its development, helping to promote Grimoire CSS, or even sponsoring the project or my work.

Thank you!
